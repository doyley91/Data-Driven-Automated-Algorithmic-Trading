\chapter{Introduction}

The stock market retains its status as a prime location for investors to invest in the market and earn a profit, however this is not always easy due to the constantly thriving and changing nature which follows the stock market. Investors are constantly presented with numerous profit potential opportunities, however without intensive planning and analysis, these opportunities could easily turn into losses. This means that it is crucial for every investor to carry out stock market ananlysis prior to any investment by monitoring past price movements in order to forecast future trends. Even though past data is not a clear indication of future movement, it is still proven to provide some useful insite. 

\section{Project goals and scope}

This report aims to disprove two hypotheses, the Efficient Market Hypotheses (EMH), and the Random Walk Hypothesis (RWH). 

\subsection{Efficient Market Hypothesis}

By definition of the EMH, it is impossible for any investor to beat the market as the markets are efficient and all stock prices always incorporate and reflect all relevant information. This essentially means that stocks are always traded at their fair value, and their prices only fluctuate when new information is released to the public. This essentially makes it impossible for any investors to exploit any inefficiencies in the market and earn a profit. Believers of the EMH claim that it is pointless to try and search for undervalued stocks, or predict market trends.

Although a vast number of academics find the EMH to be true, there are still a number of investors who have consistently beaten the market over long periods of time, something which is impossible by definition according to the EMH. Stock market crashes, such as that of the financial crisis of 1987, in which the market fell 28.3\% in a single day, proving that stock prices can seriously deviate from their fair values.  

It is the firm belief of proponents of the EMH that investors are better off investing in low risk index funds. It is a known fact that only a few number of active managers successfully manage to outperform passive funds.

\subsection{Random Walk Hypothesis}

According to the RWH, it is not possible to use the past movement or trend of a stock price to predict its future movement. The main idea of the RWH is all stocks take a random and unpredictable path. Strong believers of the RWH believe that it is not possible to beat the market without taking on more risk.

There are however a vast number of critics of this theory, who state that stocks do indeed follow trends over time, making it possible to carry out stock market analysis and carefully select entry and exit points for stock investments.
