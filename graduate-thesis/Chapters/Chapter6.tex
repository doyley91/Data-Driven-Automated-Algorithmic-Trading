\chapter{Conclusion}

Three financial forecasting methods were presented in this report, two of which showed little to no potential of ever producing any statistically significant result when the correct methodology was applied. The third method, machine learning, showed some potential in the tests carried out, which is why this method was built into an automated algorithmic strategy to trade with. The algorithm proved to be successful in forecasting future prices, using both classification and regression methods. However, the backesting proved this method to fail in forecasting price falls. Once this factor was removed from the equation, the algorithms were very successful and reported a profit by the end of the test. This is however not always ideal as stocks which could fall in price could be catastrophic to the strategy. A stop loss would be ideal in insuring that no positions are held in downward falling stocks.

If there is anything that this report shows, it is that profitable stock market prediction is an extremely tough problem. Even through the strategy reported a profit by the end of the backtest, it still did not beat the market. Whether it is possible at all ultimately remains an open question.

After completing the project, it is the firm belief of the author that the only viable trading strategy for a casual investor is a passive buy and hold strategy in index funds and ETFs.
